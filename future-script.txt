INT. DAVE APARTMENT - AFTERNOON

Dave young man at home browsing his phone gets a text message.

TEXT MESSAGE (UNKNOWN)
I KNOW THE FUTURE… click here: https://futuretellingapp.com 

Dave is about to delete the message, instead grimaces and presses the link.

DAVE
What the heck?

APP VOICE
Hello you may ask one question about the future a day.

Dave presses the microphone button and speaks to his phone.

DAVE
What is the weather tomorrow?

He clicks submit and the app voice responds.

APP VOICE
Tomorrow it will be warm and rainy. 

Dave smiles, and presses the microphone again.

DAVE
How will the world end?

APP VOICE
I’m sorry, only question a day. See you tomorrow!

Dave chuckles and gets ready for his date.

INT. APARTMENT EVENING

Dave and Patricia eating dinner together. Patricia is a woman Dave met online and has been dating for a while. They have had sex twice but generally just eat together in near silence. Tonight is the same. The only sound is clinking of silverware. 

DAVE
Do you want to stay over tonight?

PATRICIA
Sure.

She smiles and chews her food.

INT. BED NIGHT

Dave face to face in bed with Patricia.

DAVE
You ready?

PATRICIA
Mnhm.

Even their sex is nearly silent. They both enjoy it but neither makes a sound. Once the sex is over they sleep far apart from each other careful not to touch feet.

INT. APARTMENT - MORNING

We hear rain. Dave makes then sips tea and stares at the rain. He opens the app again and presses the microphone.

DAVE
Who will I eventually marry?

APP VOICE
I’m sorry, but you will never get married.

Dave is miffed.

DAVE
Okay, freaking app.

Dave’s phone rings. It’s his pal Rob. Dave answers.

ROB
YO.

DAVE
Hey buddy, do something for me, check out this link i just sent you.

ROB
ok.

DAVE
Ask it which stock you should buy today.

ROB
Okay. Hey Dave did you know lawn jockeys are not horse jockeys? They got the hat and the boots, but are totally different. It’s really confusing.

DAVE
What?

ROB
Endurance Oil. It says endurance oil, what is this scam site? Did I just get identity thefted?

Dave buys some Endurance stock.

DAVE
Maybe. What are you doing?

ROB
Jack shit. Come over. 

DAVE
Nah.

ROB
I’m gonna ask it who the next president will be. Ah? One question a day? Dumb.

DAVE
You could come over here.

ROB
Ah, how about tomorrow? After work. 

DAVE
Sweet.

ROB
Aight mane, later.



INT. APARTMENT - NEXT DAY

Dave checks his stocks. Sure enough Endurance stock was number one that day. 

DAVE
Crazy.

Rob knock on the door. Dave lets him in.

ROB
Dude, what you been up to?

DAVE
Pff, basically this is it man. Working. Sleeping you know.

Rob walks to the kitchen like he owns the place.

INT. KITCHEN

ROB
Bro, you got this popcorn popper yet you never make popcorn. (LOOKS IN PANTRY) Yep lots of popcorn. 

INT. LIVING ROOM

Dave closes the windows and blocks the vents. Then rolls them a spliff. Rob is popping his popcorn. 

INT. KITCHEN

ROB
Have you noticed how much kids are into tag? There is nothing a six year old would rather be doing than playing tag. You know what I mean? 

INT. LIVING ROOM

Dave plays music and sparks up the nice long spliff. Rob enters and sits with a big bowl of popcorn. They start a video game.

DAVE
Hey that stock blew up.

ROB
Hmm. Okay, 

Dave loads the app and asks.

DAVE
When will I die?

App takes a moment to calculate.

APP VOICE
Unfortunately you will die tonight. 

The stunned friends look at each other. 

DAVE
Shit. I should have asked it what the lottery number are.

Rob takes out his phone and loads the app.

ROB
How will my friend Dave die tonight?

APP VOICE
Dave is accidentally killed by his friend Rob.

Rob stands spilling popcorn. 

ROB
Should I leave? 

DAVE
No. Well. Maybe.

ROB
What the heck?

Dave googles futuretellingapp.com.

DAVE
It’s not on Google.

ROB
How is that possible?

DAVE
What the heck?

ROB
Where did you get the link?

DAVE
Text message from an unknown number.

Dave relights the joint. And starts playing the game again.

ROB
This is crazy maybe it’s AI? 

Rob puffs the joint. Dave pops opens more beers. 

DAVE
You remember that app Randonautica? 

ROB
Sounds familiar.

DAVE
Supposedly it used quantum computing to find weird stuff. And people would get there and figure out reasons why yes it was a scary location. And then sometimes people would actually find crazy stuff.

ROB
Like that bag of body parts that girl found in the ocean.

DAVE 
Yeah like that but the thing is it was usually just nonsense but sometimes, coincidentally, something crazy would happen. 

ROB
It’s gotta be, like next month we are gonna find out the app was promo for some movie.

DAVE 
Right!

ROB
That was crazy though.

The friends stare at each suspiciously. The clocks ticks. Dave’s eyes widen. Rob frowns deeply in terror. They both burst out laughing.

ROB
What was in that joint?

DAVE
Yeah.

Rob pours himself some wine.

ROB
I feel really groggy right now.

DAVE
You wanna crash over here?

ROB
Yeah for a minute.

Dave turns off the light.

DAVE
You remember New Years 2016?

ROB
Vaguely.

DAVE
We went to your friends New Year party. And I’m trying to remember who it was.

ROB
There was that girl who was kissing everybody, on the cheek. Whose house was that?? I remember New Years 2020 though.

DAVE
At Club One? When the power went out. That was nuts.

ROB
I was so drunk, I ended up wandering outside and getting lost It was so cold as hell. And my phone was dead. I was gonna walk home and you pull up like, “Hey, need a ride”? You probably saved my life.

DAVE
I mean it was only a 10 mile walk. 

ROB
Well I appreciated it.

DAVE
Of course bro, you’re my homie. Honestly, if anyone was gonna to kill me, I’m glad it’s you.

ROB
Thanks man. Me too. 

The friends drift off shoulder to shoulder. 

INT. KITCHEN

Under a mess of spilled popcorn natural gas has been pouring into the poorly ventilated apartment all night.

FADE TO BLACK
