User Page consists of subforms with sections, layouts, elements, and components. 

A subform is the current page. It is a container for section cards which are direct decendants of the subform.

The subform is the page you insert section cards into. 

Do not remove the subform! You can style and edit it but never remove the subform!

Section cards consist of rows and cols. Rows are flex-flow elements. You can use class names .rows and .cols to construct grids inside the section card.

Every HTML element must contain a unique data-node-id attribute. Reference the data-node-id attribute to identify the element.

Every element must have a unique data-node-id attribute.

Elements must have valid inline styling. The only class names available are .row and .col. 

Keep styles and alignments consistent. 

Section cards flow down the subform page vertically and contain rows and columns.

It is very important to always correctly identify the data-node-id attribute in the user current HTML BEFORE making changes to the page.
