{"role":"user","content":"INT. DAVE APARTMENT - AFTERNOON\r\n\r\nDave young man at home browsing his phone gets a text message.\r\n\r\nUNKNOWN\r\nI KNOW THE FUTURE… click here: https://futuretellingapp.com \r\n\r\nDave is about to delete the message, instead grimaces and presses the link.\r\n\r\nDAVE\r\nWhat the heck?\r\n\r\nMinimal ui/ux that simply asks: What is your Question?\r\n\r\nDave presses the microphone button and speaks to his phone.\r\n\r\nDAVE\r\nWhat will the weather be like tomorrow?\r\n\r\nHe clicks submit and the app voice responds.\r\n\r\nAPP VOICE\r\nTomorrow it will be warm and mostly cloudy and rain for approximately 9 of the 24 hours. \r\n\r\nDave smiles, and presses the microphone again.\r\n\r\nDAVE\r\nHow will the world end?\r\n\r\nAPP VOICE\r\nI’m sorry, only question is allowed per day. See you tomorrow!\r\n\r\nDave chuckles and gets up to get ready for his date.\r\n\r\nINT. APARTMENT EVENING\r\n\r\nDave and Patricia eating dinner together. Patricia is a woman Dave met online and has been dating for a while. They have had sex twice but generally just eat together in near silence. Tonight is the same. The only sound is clinking of silverware. \r\n\r\nDAVE\r\nDo you want to stay over tonight?\r\n\r\nPATRICIA\r\nSure.\r\n\r\nShe smiles and chews her food.\r\n\r\nINT. BED NIGHT\r\n\r\nDave face to face in bed with Patricia.\r\n\r\nDAVE\r\nYou ready?\r\n\r\nPATRICIA\r\nMnhm.\r\n\r\nEven their sex is nearly silent. They both enjoy it but neither makes a sound. Once the sex is over they sleep far apart from each other careful not to touch feet.\r\n\r\nINT. APARTMENT - MORNING\r\n\r\nDave is warming tea on his gas stove. We hear rain. Dressed in his bathrobe Dave sips tea in front of this slide-glass door and stares at the pouring rain. He feels conflicted about sleeping with Patricia. Dave opens the app again and presses the microphone.\r\n\r\nDAVE\r\nWho will I eventually marry?\r\n\r\nAPP VOICE\r\nI’m sorry, but you will never get married.\r\n\r\nDave is miffed.\r\n\r\nDAVE\r\nOkay, freaking app.\r\n\r\nDave’s phone rings. It’s his pal Rob. Dave answers.\r\n\r\nROB\r\nYO.\r\n\r\nDAVE\r\nHey buddy, do something for me, check out this link i just sent you.\r\n\r\nROB\r\nok.\r\n\r\nDAVE\r\nAsk it which stock you should buy today.\r\n\r\nROB\r\nOkay. Hey Dave did you know lawn jockeys are not horse jockeys? They got the hat and the boots, but are totally different. It’s really confusing.\r\n\r\nDAVE\r\nWhat?\r\n\r\nROB\r\nEndurance Oil. It says endurance oil, what is this scam site? Did I just get identity thefted?\r\n\r\nDave buys some Endurance stock.\r\n\r\nDAVE\r\nMaybe. What are you doing?\r\n\r\nROB\r\nJack shit. Come over. \r\n\r\nDAVE\r\nNah.\r\n\r\nROB\r\nI’m gonna ask it who the next president will be. Ah? One question a day? Dumb.\r\n\r\nDAVE\r\nYou could come over here.\r\n\r\nROB\r\nAh, how about tomorrow? After work. \r\n\r\nDAVE\r\nSweet.\r\n\r\nROB\r\nAight mane, later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINT. APARTMENT - NEXT DAY\r\n\r\nDave checks his stocks. Sure enough Endurance stock was number one that day. \r\n\r\nDAVE\r\nCrazy.\r\n\r\nRob knock on the door. Dave lets him in.\r\n\r\nROB\r\nDude, what you been up to?\r\n\r\nDAVE\r\nPff, basically this is it man. Working. Sleeping you know.\r\n\r\nRob walks to the kitchen like he owns the place.\r\n\r\nINT. KITCHEN\r\n\r\nROB\r\nBro, you got this popcorn popper yet you never make popcorn. (LOOKS IN PANTRY) Yep lots of popcorn. \r\n\r\nINT. LIVING ROOM\r\n\r\nDave closes the windows and blocks the vents. Then rolls them a spliff. Rob is popping his popcorn. \r\n\r\nINT. KITCHEN\r\n\r\nROB\r\nHave you noticed how much kids are into tag? There is nothing a six year old would rather be doing than playing tag. You know what I mean? \r\n\r\nINT. LIVING ROOM\r\n\r\nDave is sparking up the nice long spliff. Rob enters and sits with a big bowl of popcorn. \r\n\r\nDAVE\r\nHey that stock blew up.\r\n\r\nROB\r\nHmm. Okay, \r\n\r\nDave loads the app and asks.\r\n\r\nDAVE\r\nWhen will I die?\r\n\r\nApp takes a moment to calculate.\r\n\r\nAPP VOICE\r\nUnfortunately you will die tonight.\r\n\r\nThe stunned friends look at each other. \r\n\r\nDAVE\r\nShit. I should have asked it what the lottery number are.\r\n\r\nRob takes out his phone and loads the app.\r\n\r\nROB\r\nHow will my friend Dave die tonight?\r\n\r\nAPP VOICE\r\nYour friend Dave is accidentally killed by his best friend Rob.\r\n\r\nRob stands spilling popcorn. They room is silent except the video game intro.\r\n\r\nROB\r\nShould I leave? \r\n\r\nDAVE\r\nNo. Maybe.\r\n\r\nThe friends Google the app.\r\n\r\nROB\r\nWhat the heck?\r\n\r\nDAVE\r\nIt’s not on Google.\r\n\r\nROB\r\nHow is that possible?\r\n\r\nDAVE\r\nWhat the heck?\r\n\r\nROB\r\nWhere did you get the link?\r\n\r\nDAVE\r\nText message from an unknown number.\r\n\r\nDave relights the joint.\r\n\r\nROB\r\nThis is crazy maybe it’s AI? I didn’t even have to login though!\r\n\r\nRob puffs the joint. Dave pops opens two beers. \r\n\r\nDAVE\r\nYou remember that app Randonautica? \r\n\r\nROB\r\nSounds familiar\r\n\r\nDAVE\r\nSupposedly it was using some quantum processing to find weird locations. And people would get there and figure out reasons why yes it was a scary location.\r\n\r\nRob starts a new video game.\r\n\r\nDAVE (CONT)\r\nAnd then sometimes people actually would find crazy stuff.\r\n\r\nROB\r\nLike that bag of body parts.\r\n\r\nDAVE \r\nRight.\r\n\r\nROB\r\nBut how is nobody on the internet talking about them?\r\n\r\nDAVE \r\nI don’t know. It’s weird.\r\n\r\nTime passes and the friends drink more beers. A pizza arrives. Dave rolls another joint while Rob plays.\r\n\r\nROB\r\nMetal Gear is the best epic video game story ever. You know what I mean?\r\nDAVE\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\nROB\r\nOver thousands of years, people might mythologize Solid Snake to the point where they think he was based on a real person. \r\n\r\nDAVE\r\nDo you just want to crash over here?\r\n\r\nROB\r\nYea, dude what did we smoke?\r\n\r\nDAVE\r\nJust normal weed. \r\n\r\nROB\r\nIT hit me weird. I feel like I smoked a CBD joint.\r\n\r\nDAVE\r\nYou remember New Years 2016?\r\n\r\nROB\r\nYeah vaguely.\r\n\r\nDAVE\r\nWe went a friend of yours New Year party. And I’m trying to remember who it was.\r\n\r\nROB\r\nYeah we walked in through the side-yard, I have no idea. How about New Years 2020?\r\n\r\nDAVE\r\nAt Club One? When the power went out.\r\n\r\nROB\r\nYes. I was so drunk, and it was so cold. Somehow I ended up separated and got lost and my phone was dead. I was walking towards the highway and you pull up like, “yo, need a ride”? You saved my ass.\r\n\r\nDAVE\r\nHonestly, if anyone was gonna to kill me, I’m glad it’s you.\r\n\r\nROB\r\nThanks man. You too. \r\n\r\nThe friends drift off into deep groggy slumbers, unaware that under the mess of spilled popcorn Dave’s broken gas line has been pumping natural gas into the poorly ventilated apartment all night.\r\n\r\nFADE TO BLACK\r\n\r\n","sessionId":"PpqEGz9yWHUGt2ILBSB1Uc_RbgJoT3CO","timestamp":{"$$date":1708501913829},"_id":"PaihJuzw6eMn5qRb"}
