Hey Dave did you know lawn jockeys are not horse jockeys? They got the hat and the boots, but are totally different. It’s really confusing.\r\n\r\nDAVE\r\nWhat?\r\n\r\nROB\r\nEndurance Oil. It says endurance oil, what is this scam site? Did I just get identity thefted?\r\n\r\nDave buys some Endurance stock.\r\n\r\nDAVE\r\nMaybe. What are you doing?\r\n\r\nROB\r\nJack shit.

It’s weird.\r\n\r\nTime passes and the friends drink more beers. A pizza arrives. Dave rolls another joint while Rob plays.\r\n\r\nROB\r\nMetal Gear is the best epic video game story ever. You know what I mean?\r\nDAVE\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\nROB\r\nOver thousands of years, people might mythologize Solid Snake to the point where they think he was based on a real person. \r\n\r\nDAVE\r\nDo you just want to crash over here?\r\n\r\nROB\r\nYea, dude what did we smoke?\r\n\r\nDAVE\r\nJust normal weed. \r\n\r\nROB\r\nIT hit me weird.

And I’m trying to remember who it was.\r\n\r\nROB\r\nYeah we walked in through the side-yard, I have no idea. How about New Years 2020?\r\n\r\nDAVE\r\nAt Club One? When the power went out.\r\n\r\nROB\r\nYes. I was so drunk, and it was so cold. Somehow I ended up separated and got lost and my phone was dead. I was walking towards the highway and you pull up like, “yo, need a ride”? You saved my ass.\r\n\r\nDAVE\r\nHonestly, if anyone was gonna to kill me, I’m glad it’s you.\r\n\r\nROB\r\nThanks man.

When the power went out.\r\n\r\nROB\r\nYes. I was so drunk, and it was so cold. Somehow I ended up separated and got lost and my phone was dead.

Come over. \r\n\r\nDAVE\r\nNah.\r\n\r\nROB\r\nI’m gonna ask it who the next president will be. Ah? One question a day?

It’s weird.\r\n\r\nTime passes and the friends drink more beers. A pizza arrives. Dave rolls another joint while Rob plays.\r\n\r\nROB\r\nMetal Gear is the best epic video game story ever. You know what I mean?\r\nDAVE\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\nROB\r\nOver thousands of years, people might mythologize Solid Snake to the point where they think he was based on a real person. \r\n\r\nDAVE\r\nDo you just want to crash over here?\r\n\r\nROB\r\nYea, dude what did we smoke?\r\n\r\nDAVE\r\nJust normal weed. \r\n\r\nROB\r\nIT hit me weird.

And I’m trying to remember who it was.\r\n\r\nROB\r\nYeah we walked in through the side-yard, I have no idea. How about New Years 2020?\r\n\r\nDAVE\r\nAt Club One? When the power went out.\r\n\r\nROB\r\nYes. I was so drunk, and it was so cold. Somehow I ended up separated and got lost and my phone was dead. I was walking towards the highway and you pull up like, “yo, need a ride”? You saved my ass.\r\n\r\nDAVE\r\nHonestly, if anyone was gonna to kill me, I’m glad it’s you.\r\n\r\nROB\r\nThanks man.
